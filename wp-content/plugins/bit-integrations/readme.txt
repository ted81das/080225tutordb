## ♻ How does this plugin work?

This plugin acts as a bridge between platforms, using Triggers and Actions. Triggers capture data, like form submissions (**Contact Form 7**, **WP Forms**, etc.), while Actions send it to **CRM**, **Email Marketing Software**, **Project Management Tools**, **Data Collection Tools**, and **other WordPress plugins**.

For example, a contact form (**Bit Form**, **WP Forms**, etc.)
is submitted, and you want to send data in your **CRM**, **Email Marketing Software**, **Project Management Tools**, **Data Collection Tools**, and **other WordPress plugins**.

## Telemetry Data

Bit Integrations uses [wp-telemetry](https://packagist.org/packages/bitapps/wp-telemetry) to collect some telemetry data upon user’s confirmation. This helps us to troubleshoot problems faster & make product improvements.

Wp-Telemetry **DOES NOT IMMEDIATELY** start gathering data, rather it will gather basic telemetry data when a user allows it. We collect the data to ensure great user experience for all our users
